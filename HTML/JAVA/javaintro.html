      <div class="headers">Java Tutorial</div>
      <div class="content"><p>  &emsp;  Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. It is a widely used robust technology.</p></div>
      
      <div class="headers">What is Java?</div>
      <div class="content">&emsp;Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

        Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</div>
        
      <div class="content">Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</div>
      <div class="headers">Application</div>
      <div class="content">According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
          <li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
          <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
          <li>Mobile</li>
          <li>Embedded System</li>
          <li>Smart Card</li>
          <li>Robotics</li>
          <li>Games, etc.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="headers">Types of Java Applications</div>
      <div class="content"> There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:   </div>
      <div class="sideheading">1) Standalone Application</div>
      <div class="content"> Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.</div>
      <div class="sideheading">2) Web Application</div>
      <div class="content">An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet
        , JSP
        , Struts
        , Spring
        , Hibernate
        , JSF
        , etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.</div>
      
      <div class="sideheading">3) Enterprise Application</div>
      <div class="content">An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB
        is used for creating enterprise applications.</div>

      <div class="sideheading">4) Mobile Application</div>
      <div class="content">An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.</div>

      <div class="headers">Java Platforms / Editions</div>
      <div class="content">There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:</div>

      <div class="sideheading">1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</div>
      <div class="content">It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String
        , Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</div>
      
      <div class="sideheading">2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)</div>
      <div class="content">It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA
        , etc.</div>

    
      <div class="sideheading">3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</div>
      <div class="content">It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.</div>

      <div class="sideheading">4) JavaFX</div>
      <div class="content">It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.</div>
